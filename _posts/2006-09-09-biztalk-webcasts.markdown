I'm not sure of how many know of [these Webcasts](http://msdn.microsoft.com/biztalk/community/webcasts/default.aspx) that Microsoft keep publishing. I didn't know of them until recently and that I've learnt a lot by viewing them. I find it a excellent way of learning new things and tips from some of the most skilled people working with BizTalk. 

I recommend the following:

  * [Design Human Workflow Solutions with BizTalk Server 2004](http://msevents.microsoft.com/cui/WebCastEventDetails.aspx?EventID=1032284450&EventCategory=5&culture=en-us&CountryCode=US) (medium)  
This is a **absolute must to watch**. The demo is this presentation is a killer! It's a complete workflow system build in **four **days that really shows the strengths of BizTalk. It's also emphasizes some important architecture best practices in BizTalk.  
  * [BizTalk Web Services and WSE](http://msevents.microsoft.com/cui/WebCastEventDetails.aspx?EventID=1032278710&EventCategory=5&culture=en-us&CountryCode=US) (medium)  
  * [Getting up to speed with BizTalk Server 2004 for the Visual Studio .NET Developer](http://msevents.microsoft.com/CUI/EventDetail.aspx?EventID=1032247084&Culture=en-US) (basic)  
  * [Biztalk Server 2004 Architecture](http://msevents.microsoft.com/CUI/WebCastEventDetails.aspx?EventID=1032262823&EventCategory=3&culture=en-US&CountryCode=US)** (basic)  
  * [Biztalk Server 2004 Orchestration for the Visual Studio .NET Developer](http://msevents.microsoft.com/CUI/WebCastEventDetails.aspx?EventID=1032262826&Culture=en-US) (basic)
