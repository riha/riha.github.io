I've often been told that one of the biggest mistakes people make when implementing a service oriented architecture is that they don't re-architect their current architecture to become service oriented. I've never really understood what they meant by that until I read [this article](http://blogs.msdn.com/nickmalik/archive/2007/08/07/getting-away-from-request-and-response-soa.aspx). SOA is not about adding a service based call to expose **your current** procedure calls as a service - it's so much more. It's about enabling ease of change and to create a more agile architecture.

<blockquote>Each of these assumptions exist in a Remote Procedure Call. They are forms of coupling, pure and simple. They fly in the face of SOA.

What do you think? Does it make sense in your world?
