I'm a loyal [ARcast](http://channel9.msdn.com/shows/ARCast_with_Ron_Jacobs) listener and I think I've listened to most of the shows that ever been produced (at least those that are available in the archive). I also listen to a couple of other podcasts that are focusing on .NET and Microsoft techniques (for example [.NET Rocks!](http://www.dotnetrocks.com/)) and in my opinion ARcast is by far the most rewarding (I guess this is both a matter of taste and depending on what kind of work one does.)! However these two shows on _Patterns and anti-patterns for SOA_ ([part 1](http://channel9.msdn.com/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=259342) and [part 2](http://channel9.msdn.com/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=260161)) really stands out! 

They really got me thinking of a couple of anti-patterns the project I'm currently working on are stuck in. And Ron Jacob delivers (as always) the message with a lot of humor and enthusiasm. Recommended!
