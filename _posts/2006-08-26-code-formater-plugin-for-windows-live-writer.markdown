I use [Windows Live Writer](http://windowslivewriter.spaces.live.com/) for writing and posting to my blog. However I've always had problems with code formating. Until now!

[This little plug in](http://http://www.codeplex.com/Wiki/View.aspx?ProjectName=WlwCodeFormatter) to Live Writer does the job!

Thanks to Steve Dunn whos excellt blog you'll find [here](http://stevedunns.blogspot.com/)
