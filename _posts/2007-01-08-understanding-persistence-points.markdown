title: "Understanding persistence points"

I found [this post from Richard Seroter's blog](http://seroter.wordpress.com/2007/01/02/orchestration-handling-of-suspended-messages/) on persistence points interesting. The post deals with the basics in persistence points and how to tweak them to get a resumed orchestration to resume at an expected step. Not understanding persistence point and not thinking about them when planing and building an orchestration might cause some strange bugs and errors.
