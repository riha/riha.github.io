title: "Reborn as BizTalk Web Documenter!"
categories: [BizTalk 2006]
---

About a year ago [I published a project](http://www.richardhallgren.com/using-biztalk-config-explorer-as-a-new-way-of-documenting-your-biztalk-solutions/) that helps automating documentation for BizTalk Server – much like [BizTalk Documenter](http://biztalk2010autodc.codeplex.com/) but with the difference that this tools instead generates a dynamic web site. I’ve called in Config Explorer, a name I knew was sh*t from the start but the best I could come up with at the time.

 

After a while however, when enough people told me that they also thought the name was crap I decided to change it to [BizTalk Web Documenter](http://btswebdoc.com/). I’ve also moved the whole [project to GitHub](https://github.com/riha/btswebdoc).

 

I'll try and spend a bit more time on the project than I have the last year and will update the [documentation](http://btswebdoc.com/), wiki and roadmap as well as implement a few new features. 

 

I hope you’ll help me – fork the project today!
