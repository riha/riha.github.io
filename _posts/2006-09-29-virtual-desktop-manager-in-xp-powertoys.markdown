Today someone complained about Windows XP's lack of virtual desktops and that Mac had the possibility to have several desktops active with different content. I remembered that had tried something like that a couple of years ago and after a while I found [Microsoft PowerToys for Windows XP](http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/downloads/powertoys/xppowertoys.mspx) again. 

The PowerToys package contains several small XP add-ins. For example the _**Virtual Desktop Manager**_!

As the image above show the manager makes it possible to have four separate desktops running at one - nice! A few configurations tips that I found useful was **_turn of the shared desktops option_** and to _**set the shortcut**_ for showing the desktops to _alt-ยง_ (that's close to the _alt-tab_ option).

An other cool application in the PowerToys package is the _**Alt-Tab Replacement**_ that shows a small preview of the different windows one is multi tasking between (as shown in the image above).
