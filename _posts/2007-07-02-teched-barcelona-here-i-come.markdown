I've just found out that I get to go to [TechEd in November](http://www.mseventseurope.com/teched/)! I haven't been there before. I've been to a lot of conferences but not **the **Microsoft conference. Do I have to say that I'm looking forward to it? 

If you're going and feel like meeting up for a BizTalk lunch, dinner or whatever don't hesitate to drop me an e-mail.
