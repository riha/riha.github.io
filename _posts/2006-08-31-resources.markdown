I've started reading [this list](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/ScottHanselmans2006UltimateDeveloperAndPowerUsersToolListForWindows.aspx). Jisses! There's is literally a ton of links to excellent resources here! 

**Validation**

I'll work my way down the list when I have some more time. However I found [this](http://www.peterblum.com/VAM/Home.aspx), seems like it could have saved my a lot if I'd known about earlier. It's a package with validation controls for ASP.NET for every situation. Looks really good.

**Date**

[This](http://www.peterblum.com/DateControls/Home.aspx) seems like another usefull resource. Loads and loads of different date controls. I'll have to remeber this site the next time I'll nedd one.
