I've realized that I never understood the full potential of the Visual Studio Database Project. None of the projects I've worked on has had a effective process on handling changes and versioning of the database schema. Test data, build scripts, changes to the local development database versus the test and production base has also been a bit bumpy. I've haven't understood that working with the Database Project potentially could solves a lot of these challenges . 

A [chapter](http://www.awprofessional.com/articles/article.asp?p=31764&seqNum=1&rl=1) from the [Database Access with Visual BasicÂ® .NET](http://www.awprofessional.com/bookstore/product.asp?isbn=0672323435&rl=1) book describes some features in the Database Project.
