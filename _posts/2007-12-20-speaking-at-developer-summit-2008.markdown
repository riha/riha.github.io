[![Developer Summit 2008](/assets/2007/12/devsum.jpg)](http://www.expertzone.se/dev08/)Whoho! I'll be speaking at [Developer Summit 2008](http://www.expertzone.se/dev08/). Developer Summit is a conference hosted by [Cornerstone](http://www.cornerstone.se/), it's being held in Stockholm between the 9th and 11th of April 2008.

I'll be doing a talk on [Master Data Management](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference_Data_Management) (MDM) for the Enterprise using BizTalk 2006. Basically I'll present some basic theory behind the MDM concept and how it relates to [SOA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-oriented_architecture). Then I'll relate all that to a customer case I recently worked on solving a MDM requirement. Finally I'll be showing a short demo where I publish some Master Data and update all subscribers to it. In the same demo I'll also demonstrate on how to monitor the process using [Business Activity Monitoring](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/biztalk/2006/evaluate/overview/default.mspx#EWC).

Sound interesting? Something specific you think should be in the presentation? Let me know!

Hope to see you there!
