categories: [BizTalk 2006, Presentation, R2]

I recently spoke at the leading developer conference here in Sweden called [Developer Summit](http://www.expertzone.se/dev08/). The talk was called _Masterdata Management using BizTalk 2006_. The slides can be found [here](http://www.richardhallgren.com/blogfiles/MasterData%20Management%20-%20Developer%20Summit%203.0.ppt).

 

I can really recommend Developer Summit as a conference. Everything is super well organized and having the opportunity to listen to celebrities like [David Chappell](http://www.davidchappell.com/blog/), [Jim Webber](http://jim.webber.name/), [Dan North](http://dannorth.net/) and [Christian Weyer](http://blogs.thinktecture.com/cweyer/) **in Sweden** is really great! 

 

This year I also liked the mix of presentation as some where more general presentation as for example Benjamin Ling who's the director of platform at Facebook and who gave an insight to how the platform is managed and developed. I also really enjoyed (besides the obvious ones as for example Christian Weyer's WCF talk) Frans Hanel's talk on the history and architecture behind a major price comparison site called [prisjakt.nu](http://prisjakt.nu/) - very interesting and a great technical mix in otherwise Microsoft focused conference.
