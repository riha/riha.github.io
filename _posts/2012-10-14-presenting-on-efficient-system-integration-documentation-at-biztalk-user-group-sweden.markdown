title: "Presenting on “Efficient system integration documentation” at BizTalk User
  Group Sweden"
categories: [BizTalk 2006]

I’ve talked a lot about efficient documentation previously on this blog, both when in comes to splitting the documentation up in different layers as [here](http://www.richardhallgren.com/using-biztalk-config-explorer-as-a-new-way-of-documenting-your-biztalk-solutions/), but also in relation to tools BizTalk Documenter and [BizTalk Web Documenter](http://btswebdoc.com/) for automatically generation technical documentation as [here](http://www.richardhallgren.com/reborn-as-biztalk-web-documenter/).

 

Last week I however had the pleasure to present on the BizTalk User Group Sweden meeting and got to talk all documentation for a whole hour ![Smile](/assets/2012/10/wlEmoticon-smile.png). You can find the PPT from the meeting [here](http://biztalkusergroup.se/blogs/info/BUGS%20docs%20-%20Richard%20Hallgren.pptx). 

 

I ended the presentation by presenting the ten commandments for efficient system integrations documentation:

 

**I.** Thou shall _not_ manually document anything that can be automatized![](http://drbristol.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/10-commandments.gif)

 

**II.** Thou shall keep it _simple_ & make it _look nice_

 

**III.** Thou shall _use a wiki_ based platform

 

**IV.** Thou shall _use pictures_ whenever appropriate

 

**V.** Thou shall have _well defined guidelines_ for your documentation

 

**VI.** Thou shall have a _well defined target audience_ for your documentation

 

**VII.** Thou shall _document continuously_ in your project

 

**VIII.** Thou shall have a _common vocabulary_ and common icons defined

 

**IX. **Thou shall _test your documentation_ with target audience

 

**X.** Thou as the _developer_ of an integration should _document it_
