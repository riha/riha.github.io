I've just started reading the new [BizTalk Server 2006 Troubleshooters Guide](http://blogs.msdn.com/biztalk_server_team_blog/archive/2006/09/13/752294.aspx), it's basically 133 pages packed with best practices and common pitfalls to avoid. It's seems to be a great resource and I'll try to use this blog to summarize some of the different parts - just have to get some more time! ;)
