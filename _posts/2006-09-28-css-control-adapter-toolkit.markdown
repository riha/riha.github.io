A while ago Microsoft released the [CSS Control Adapter Toolkit](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2006/05/02/CSS-Control-Adapter-Toolkit-for-ASP.NET-2.0-.aspx) for ASP.NET 2.0. It finally makes it possible to use all the time saving ASP.NET controls in 2.0 without all the horrible HTML they used to produce. The toolkit gives access to the now improved source of the following adapter controls:

  * Menu 
  * TreeView 
  * GridView
  * DetailsView 
  * FormsView 
  * DataList 
  * Login
  * ChangePassword
  * CreateUser
  * PasswordRecovery
  * LoginStatus

Make sure to have the latest [update](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2006/09/08/CSS-Control-Adapter-Toolkit-Update.aspx). The update fixed a few things in the old controls and added a couple more.

One can almost think of the this toolkit as a patch for ASP.NET and **when creating a public website this really is a must**!
