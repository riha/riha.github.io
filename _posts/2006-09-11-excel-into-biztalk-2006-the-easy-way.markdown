FarPoint just released a [pipeline disassembler component for Excel documents](http://www.fpoint.com/biztalk/default.aspx) (called "FarPoint Spread for Microsoft® BizTalk® Server 2006"). It looks pretty cool! It comes with a "Spreadsheet Schema wizard" that integrates with Visual Studio 2005. It could potentially save a lot of work.

I guess the reason that Microsoft hasn't released anything like this is that they like to push the use of Infopath. Basically everything would be much easier if one uses Infopath, but there might be situations where this isn't possible.
